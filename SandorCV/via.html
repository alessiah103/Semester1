        <h3>Life at VIA</h3>
    
        <p>Independence in learning, personal responsibility and freedom characterize the student experience at VIA. All our study programmes consist 
        of a combination of theoretical teaching and practice and most have obligatory internships at real workplaces. Outside of school there are plenty 
        of options to engage in extracurricular activities both on and off campus.</p>
    
        <h3>Entrepreneurial spirit</h3>
    
        <p>VIA has been awarded with the prize as Denmark’s leading entrepreneurial institution of higher education in 2014, 2018 and 2019 and 
        entrepreneurship in an integrated part of all study programmes. In addition, VIA offers guidance and counselling to students starting 
        their own businesses.</p>
    
        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    
        <p>Another key theme at VIA is sustainability. All VIA students have circular thinking, sustainability and the UN’s 
        Sustainable Development Goals on their curriculums, which means that VIA graduates will be able to contribute to a sustainable 
        agenda and development in their future workplaces.</p>
