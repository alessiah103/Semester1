            <p class="lead">The Potato (Solanum tuberosum) originated in the Andes of South America 8,000 years ago. It
                was around 6,000
                years ago that Incas in Peru first cultivated them. The Peruvian Quechua language records more than
                1,000 words
                to describe potatoes and potato varieties! The potato was believed to have medicinal qualities and was
                rubbed on
                the skin of sick patients as a remedy.</p>

            <h2 class="h4">POTATOES ARRIVE IN EUROPE</h2>
            <p>However, the invading Spanish conquistadors centuries later also loved the Peruvians' potatoes. The
                Spaniards had
                been on the look out for gold and jewels - potatoes became one of the exotic finds they excitedly
                brought back
                to Europe to impress royalty in 1536. The word ‘potato’ known in Spanish as ‘patata’ is derived from the
                word
                ‘batata’.</p>

            <h2 class="h4">POTATO POPULARITY SPREADS</h2>
            <p>In France, Antoine-August Parmentier helped King Louis XIV make the potato a popular hit in the 18th
                century.
                Having been imprisoned in Germany - where he was fed only potatoes - he knew how to create a feast of
                fabulous
                dishes all based on this one ingredient. One guest at a Parmentier Feast was legendary American
                statesman
                Benjamin Franklin. He enjoyed it so much he spread the word to the "New World" funnily enough the
                continent
                potatoes had been taken from by the Spanish. "French Fries" officially arrived in the United States of
                America
                when Thomas Jefferson served them at the White House during his presidency of 1801-1809.</p>

            <p>The potato started being grown in London by 1597, and soon became popular in Ireland and Scotland.
                Popularity for
                the potato came during the Industrial Revolution, when demand was created for cheap, energy-rich,
                non-cereal
                foods. Potatoes went on to become the basis for many peoples' essential nutrition around the world. When
                a
                fungus destroyed the potato crop in Ireland in 1845 the death toll of the infamous Irish Potato Famine
                was
                immense.</p>

            <h2 class="h4">Invention of Crisps</h2>
            <p>People also began to realise quite how versatile the potato was sometimes by accident. In 1853 railway
                magnate
                Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt sent his serving of potatoes back at a swanky restaurant in Saratoga
                Springs,
                USA. The fact that he'd rejected them for being too thick enraged the chef, George Crum. To get his own
                back he
                sarcastically sliced them incredibly thin, fried them in hot oil and threw salt all over them before
                sending
                them back to the haughty customer. To everyone's amazement, the mighty Vanderbilt absolutely loved his
                "Saratoga
                Crunch Chips" and potato crisps have been a big hit ever since.</p>
